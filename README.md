This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using nested wildcard routes in React Router v6.  The issue arises when a route with a wildcard path (`/*`) is placed as a child of another route.  In this scenario, the wildcard route will always match, overriding any other routes defined within the parent. The solution shows how to restructure your routes to avoid this conflict and ensure correct path matching.
